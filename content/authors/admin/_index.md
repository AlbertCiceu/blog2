I am a PhD candidate in forestry living and working in Romania. My research interests are forest growth models and how individual trees grow based on different environmental conditions and neighboring competition. I like playing with and testing different statistical concepts and methods, building pretty graphs that can tell informative stories and I prefer doing all that in R. During the last year of my Bachelor degree, I discovered the R statistics programming language but really got the hang of it recently. I decided to keep track of my work and write a blog about the stuff that I learn, mostly to not forget them, but maybe as a source of information for others too.
